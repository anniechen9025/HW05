### 5. Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

Create a colorcode planner


### Motivation

We had learn basic functions we can use to communicate with our page by using Javascript. As we dig in more on DOM using javascript. This hw practice to understanding how to combined all the function we had learn in the class practice to make work planner which background color will change while time passing. And using local storage to save the event they write in the planner and make it stay even after page refreshed.

#### Code style

Javascript, HTML and CSS


### Summary

I use Bootstrap to layout my Work Planner, by using moment.js function to get the user time which compare that to the id i set for each time box to compare them to make the background color changed. Also using local storage to save the data they insert in the textarea as event and save it to the coordinate time box, so I can pull out the data to the correct box even if the page is refreshed.
